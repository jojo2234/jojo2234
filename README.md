### Hello

<!-- - 🔭 I’m currently working on my homeserver where I host www.loyarpi.com -->
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a painting technique by following Bob Ross's tutorials. As a Blender artist, I need to improve my art skills.
- 🎓 I have learned how to programm in C, C#, VB, Java, Python and I know how to set instructions in GCODE. I'm also able to create web services using HTML5, CSS3, JS, PHP, JSP/servlets.
- 💾 I know how to install, use and mantain these operating systems: Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenBSD, Arch, MS-DOS, Windows (from 95 to 11), OS X Catalina (Hackintosh).
- 📐 My favourite software includes LibreOffice, which I used to write my own tech magazine, GIMP (in my opinion better than Photoshop), Inkscape and Blender.
<!-- 📚 Suggested books and litterature are: -->
