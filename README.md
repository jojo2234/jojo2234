### Hello

<!-- - üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on my homeserver where I host www.loyarpi.com -->

- üéì I have learned how to programm in C, C#, VB, Java, Python and I know how to set instructions in GCODE. I'm also able to create web services using HTML5, CSS3, JS, PHP, JSP/servlets.
- üíæ I know how to install, use and mantain these operating systems: Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenBSD, Arch, MS-DOS, Windows (from 95 to 11), OS X Catalina (Hackintosh).
